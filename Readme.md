# NetBootExplorer
A simple utility for troubleshooting Windows Deployment Services, specifically for finding duplicate netbootGUIDs in Active Directory.

It will connect to the domain that the host computer belongs to, provided that your user account and/or computer account has read access to Active Directory.

It will allow you to search for specific netbootGUIDs or mac addresses, once the directory is "cached".
